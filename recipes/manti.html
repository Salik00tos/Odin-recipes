    <h2>Turkish Dumplings</h2>
    <p>
      Turkish dumplings, known as manti, are a beloved dish that embodies the
      heart of Turkish culinary tradition. These tiny, handmade dumplings are
      filled with a mixture of ground beef or lamb, finely chopped onions, and a
      blend of spices like black pepper and salt. The delicate dough, rolled out
      thinly and cut into small squares, is folded over the filling, forming a
      variety of shapes, often resembling tiny parcels or triangles. Manti is
      typically boiled, although regional variations may bake or steam them. The
      magic lies in their preparation and the care required to craft each piece,
      often involving the whole family in a communal, joyful activity.

    <p>
      Once cooked, manti is traditionally served with a generous topping of
      creamy yogurt mixed with garlic, and drizzled with a sizzling butter sauce
      infused with red pepper flakes or paprika. A sprinkle of dried mint or
      sumac adds an aromatic touch, enhancing the dish's layers of flavor. This
      hearty and comforting meal has a strong cultural significance, often
      prepared for special occasions or as a way to bring families together.
      Whether enjoyed in a bustling Turkish restaurant or as a homemade treat,
      manti is a perfect example of how simple ingredients can be transformed
      into a rich and deeply satisfying culinary experience.

    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Red Pepper Oil</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Yogurt Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water,
        mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft
        dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set
        over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground
        beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until
        mashed. Set filling aside.
      </li>
      <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on
        the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into
        2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the
        edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle.
        Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to
        prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low
        heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and
        keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook
        manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is
        tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle
        with pepper oil.
      </li>
    </ol>
